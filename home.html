        <h1 class="h2">How dangerous are firecrackers?</h1>
        <p class="p1">Firecrackers have been affecting many people in the world. A study estimates that in 2005-2014, 3447 people died due to firecrackers in India.
             I hope you are getting the idea how firecrackers affects the health of people and how dangerous it really is. Firecrackers also cause many lung issues and difficulty in breathing.
             Many governments have banned the use of firecrackers but yet people break that rule. There are green crackers which often people don't use. Green crackers reduce around 30% of the carbon emission.
             If everyone starts using green crackers than we will win the fight against global warming. People think that global warming is a very normal thing which will be fixed in some years but they don't realize
             how much damage they do to the environment by bursting crackers which worsens the situation of global warming.
